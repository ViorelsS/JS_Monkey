# 🐵 Peek-a-Boo Monkey

A fun and interactive monkey animation built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The monkey covers its eyes with its hands, and when you click on it, the monkey removes its hands, revealing its eyes—click again to toggle the hands back over the eyes. This project was inspired by the tutorial from [Brian Design](https://www.youtube.com/@briandesign).

## 🚀 Features

- Clickable animation where the monkey alternates between covering and uncovering its eyes.
- Purely built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for smooth interaction.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
